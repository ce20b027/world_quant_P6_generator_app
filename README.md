Using Stable Diffusion to create images from text descriptions. Involves assembling the Stable Diffusion pipeline using several pre-trained neural networks, and fine-tuning the networks to include new image information. Creating and deploying a Streamlit app to be a front-end to fine-tuned Stable Diffusion model with the goal of generating meme-worthy images. This allows non-technical marketing team to generate such images easily. Specifics include:

- Working with the  pieces that make up the Stable Diffusion process.
- Using the pipelines that Stable Diffusion provides.
- Using LoRA to fine-tune Stable Diffusion with your own images. 
- Creating a Streamlit app that lets users interact with Stable Diffusion.
- Making the app accessible to others by deploying it to Streamlit Community Cloud.
